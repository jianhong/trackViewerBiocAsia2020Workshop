Description: The trackViewer package can be used to generate lollipop plot to 
    depict the methylation and SNP/mutation status, together with coverage data
    and annotation tracks to facilitate integrated analysis of multi-omics data.
    In addition, trackViewer can be easily integrated into standard analysis 
    pipeline for various high-throughput sequencing dataset such as ChIP-seq, 
    RNA-seq, methylation-seq or DNA-seq. The images produced by trackViewer 
    are highly customizable including labels, symbols, colors and size.
